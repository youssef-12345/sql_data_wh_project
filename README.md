# 🧠 Modern Data Warehouse Project

This project implements a layered Data Warehouse architecture based on the **Bronze–Silver–Gold** paradigm, widely used in modern data platforms. The goal is to collect, clean, and serve data to meet business and analytical needs in a structured and scalable way.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The pipeline follows a three-layer model:

### 🥉 Bronze Layer
- Raw data ingestion as-is from source systems.
- No transformation or cleaning applied at this stage.
- Purpose: historical traceability and data recovery.

### 🥈 Silver Layer
- Cleansed and transformed data.
- Handles missing values, removes duplicates, formats columns.
- Implemented using SQL-based transformations and **stored procedures**.
- Ready for analytical queries and joins across sources.

### 🥇 Gold Layer
- Business-ready **views** designed for specific reporting and analytical use-cases.
- Data is aggregated and modeled based on stakeholder requirements.
- Examples: KPI dashboards, sales reports, customer segmentation.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **SQL Server** (or your DBMS of choice)
- **T-SQL** and **Stored Procedures**
- **Views** for the Gold Layer

## 📊 Example Use Case

> Clean customer and transaction data to generate business views such as:
> - Monthly Sales Summary
> - Top-Selling Products
> - Customer Lifetime Value

## 👨‍💻 Notes

This project was initially inspired by a tutorial, but fully built and adapted using my own approach to reinforce learning and build practical skills in real-world data warehousing design.
